## <u>AIM</u>  
To implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Approach 2.

---

## Algorithm

1. *Board Representation*  
   - Explain how the board is stored  
   - Example: 2 → empty, 3 → X, 5 → O

2. *Display Board*  
   - Mention how the board is displayed  
   - Example: '_' for empty, 'X' for computer, 'O' for human

3. **Winning Move Check (POSSWIN)**  
   - Describe the logic for checking possible winning moves 
   - You can use math notation like:  
     - If product = 18 → computer wins next  
     - If sum = $15$ → player wins

4. **Make a Move (GO)**  
   - Explain move placement logic  

5. *Check Win Condition*  
   - Add conditions in bullet or math form

6. *Check Draw*  
   - Add logic here

7. **Helper Function (e.g., MAKE2)**  
   - Describe center/sides logic

8. *Game Loop*  
   - Describe turn-by-turn logic (computer vs human)

## Time Complexity  
- For each move, checks a constant number of winning lines.  
- *Time Complexity:* O(1)  

---

## Space Complexity  
- Uses fixed arrays for board/magic square.  
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)  

---

## Use Cases  
## Use Cases  
- *Educational Purpose:* Helps students learn how algorithms can be applied to simple games.  
- *Game Development:* Can be used as a base for building simple AI opponents in Tic-Tac-Toe.
